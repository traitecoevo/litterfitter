Description: Fit different model forms to single-cohort litter 
    decomposition data (mass remaining through time) using likelihood-based 
    estimation. Models span simple empirical to process-motivated forms with 
    differing numbers of free parameters. Provides parameter estimates, 
    uncertainty, and tools for model comparison/selection. Based on 
    Cornwell & Weedon (2013) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12138>.
