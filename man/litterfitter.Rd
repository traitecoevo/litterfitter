\title{litterfitter: methods for fitting curves to litter decomposition trajectories}
\description{
There is a long tradition of studying the flux of carbon from
the biosphere to the atmosphere by following a particular cohort of litter
(wood, leaves, roots, or other organic material) through time.  The
resulting data are mass remaining and time.  A variety of functional forms
may be used to fit the resulting data.  Some work better empirically.
Some are better connected to a process-based understanding.
Some have a small number of free parameters; others have more.
This package matches decomposition data to a set of these curves
using likelihood--based fitting.
